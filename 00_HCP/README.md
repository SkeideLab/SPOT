# 00_HCP

00_HCP includes all codes for the retinotopy analysis (dataprep, ccfanalysis, and retinotopyanalysis) for Human connectome project dataset (adolescent and adult)
Note, preprocessed HCP dataset is already in the fs_LR space so you only need a transformation from fs_LR to fsaverage.

# Folders

- `template` : This folder has retinotopy templates (Benson's eccentricity and polarangle and Wang's template) on the fs_LR space and the transformation from fsaverage to fs_LR space.
- `ccf_model` : This folder has subcodes are included in `HCP_ccf_model`, it is same with `02_ccfanalysis>ccf_model`

# Sequence of code
1. `HCP_run_all` : Contains following codes 
   - `HCP_file_prep`: convert cifti to gifti
   - `HCP_warp_templates to native`: transformation from fsaverage to fsLR
   - `HCP_simulation_model`: generate simulated data on V1 and V2
   - `HCP_ccf_model`: run cortical connective field modeling
   - `HCP_retinotopy_analysis`: project V1 retinotopy template values to V2 based on cortico-connective field results
   - `HCP_native_to fsaverage`: transform eccentricity and polar angle maps from fsLR space to fsaverage space

2. `HCP_parameter_to_fsaverage`: transform r, r^2, sigma, v0 from fsLR space to fsaverage space
3. `averaged_retinotopy`: average eccentricity and polar angle maps
4. `HCP_median_correlation`: calculate median correlation
5. `HCP_MSD`: calculate mean square difference between real and simulated data
