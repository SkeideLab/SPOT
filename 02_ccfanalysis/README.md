# 02_ccfanalysis

Runs cortical connective field modelling based on V1 vertices fitting with data of V2 vertices. For exact model description, see SPOT/documentation/CorticalConnectiveFields.pdf.

## Directory structure

`run_model.py`: contains all process of cortical connective field modelling. The functions used in the code are saved in `ccf_model`.
Input: Wang's template, white matter surface, curv surface, functional image
Output: center voxel of connective field in V1 (v0), distance from the seeds along cortical surface (sigma), correlation coefficient between V1 seed vertex and V2 vertex (rss), r^2 (r)
